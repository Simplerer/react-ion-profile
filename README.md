  ## Description
  To showcase the skills of a widely used and innovative program, I created a new professional profile. This profile is a base for what I plan to accomplish with future projects, especially as I continue to learn all the tricks that react has to offer. I relied on Bootswatch for theme and layout throughout several navigable pages and I have implemented mobile responsiveness as well. The links on the bottom will take you to all of my outside accounts and the projects themselves will bring you to their working sites or git repositories respectively.
